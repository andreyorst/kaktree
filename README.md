# Project status

Because I have stopped using Kakoune, this project will not receive active maintenance. The issues section has been closed, as I do not plan to address any issues myself. However, I welcome pull requests from anyone who encounters problems with this plugin and knows how to resolve them.

# kaktree

![kaktree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/59667890-2d397780-91c0-11e9-9214-e32b04539e7a.png)

This plugin displays the interactive file tree. It requires Perl, as well as
`ls` command that supports at least `-1`, `-F`, `-b`, `-L`, and `-A`
flags. Works best with Tmux.

## Installation
You need latest Kakoune build from master in order to use
this plugin.

### With [plug.kak](https://github.com/andreyorst/plug.kak)
Add this to your `kakrc`:

```sh
plug "andreyorst/kaktree" config %{
    hook global WinSetOption filetype=kaktree %{
        remove-highlighter buffer/numbers
        remove-highlighter buffer/matching
        remove-highlighter buffer/wrap
        remove-highlighter buffer/show-whitespaces
    }
    kaktree-enable
}
```

Restart Kakoune or re-source your `kakrc` and call `plug-install` command.

### Without plugin manager
Clone this repository to your `autoload` directory, or source `kaktree.kak` file
from your `kakrc`.

It's strongly recommended to disable line numbers and wrap highlighters as shown
in the `plug.kak` example above.

## Configuration
There are set of options that affect how `kaktree` works:

- `kaktreeclient` - the name of the client that will be used to display
  `kaktree` buffer.
- `kaktree_split` - how to split TMUX (horizontally or vertically).
- `kaktree_side` - the side where `kaktree` buffer will be displayed in TMUX.
- `kaktree_size` - size of the split.
- `kaktree_dir_icon_close` - icon for closed directory.
- `kaktree_dir_icon_open` - icon for opened directory.
- `kaktree_file_icon` - icon for files.
- `kaktree_show_hidden` - whether to show hidden files
- `kaktree_hlline` - configures highlighting of current line in the tree.
- `kaktree_sort` - whether to sort items in the tree.
- `kaktree_double_click_duration` - amount of time Kakoune waits to register
  double clicks in the Kaktree.
- `kaktree_show_help` - whether to display help box on first launch of Kaktree.
- `kaktree_tab_open_file` - whether Kaktree should open file if <kbd>Tab</kbd>
  key was pressed over it.

For example, to have nice folder and file icons as on the screenshot add this to
your configuration (assuming that your font has these characters and your
terminal can handle wide Unicode symbols):

```
plug "andreyorst/kaktree" defer kaktree %{
    set-option global kaktree_double_click_duration '0.5'
    set-option global kaktree_indentation 1
    set-option global kaktree_dir_icon_open  '‚ñæ üóÅ '
    set-option global kaktree_dir_icon_close '‚ñ∏ üóÄ '
    set-option global kaktree_file_icon      '‚†Ä‚†Äüñ∫'
} config %{...}
```

If you're not using plug.kak, replace `defer` with `hook global
ModuleLoaded`. Beware that `'‚†Ä‚†Äüñ∫'` the first two characters here are not
ordinary spaces, but invisible Unicode symbols. Currently Kaktree handles tree
structure based on indentation, so in order to do alignment of icons you should
use something that doesn't match `\s` regexp atom.
